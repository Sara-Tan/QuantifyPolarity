# QuantifyPolarity

**QuantifyPolarity** is a free software 
capable of quantifying planar polarity and cell shape automatically in epithelia using
comprehensive mathematical formulas. QuantifyPolarity provides image visualization,
cell polarity and shape quantification services to students, scientists and other
professional establishments around the world.

This software has been published in journal [Development](https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.198952).


## Installation
Binaries for installation are available on our [Releases Page](https://github.com/QuantifyPolarity/QuantifyPolarity/releases). Simply download and extract the `.zip` file, then follow the installation instructions provided in the accompanying PDF.

## Tutorials
Get started with QuantifyPolarity through our documentation and tutorials:

### Quick Start
Begin by downloading [a collection of simulation images](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bBv6Dxf5jOm-VVpk6fNRFIoXGaxmufS4?usp=sharing) (used for validation in our publication) to explore QuantifyPolarity's capabilities.

### User Manual
A detailed user manual is included within the downloaded `.zip` file. Alternatively, it can be accessed directly from the software via the <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff14ba8b-0ccd-479f-9012-ab9e4d93f8d7" width="30" alt="Help Button"> Help Button in the GUI.
