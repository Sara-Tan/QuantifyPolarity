# QuantifyPolarity

QuantifyPolarity, is a free software,
capable of quantifying planar polarity and cell shape automatically in epithelia using
comprehensive mathematical formulas. QuantifyPolarity provides image visualization,
cell polarity and shape quantification services to students, scientists and other
professional establishments around the world.

The source code is currently under reviewed and will be released soon.
[Releases for Windows and macOS](https://github.com/QuantifyPolarity/QuantifyPolarity/releases) are now available (Installation procedure and User manual can be found in the .zip file).
